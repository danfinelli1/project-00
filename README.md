Racing Game

The goal of this project was simply to design a fully functional racing game.

Technologies Used

I used the following Technologies:
-javascript
-HTML
-CSS
-Bootstrap

Existing Features

My racing game has a few interesting features:
-Reports winner's name back to them.
-Slows down the car when it strays the path.
-Keeps track of wins, loses, and ties.

Planned Features

If able to continue working on this project I would love to add a few things:
-a live scoreboard
-a reset for the board
-any and all of the bonus ideas
-a real track
-real cars
